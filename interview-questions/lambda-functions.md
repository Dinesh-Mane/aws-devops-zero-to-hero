## 💡 **What is AWS Lambda?**
**AWS Lambda** ही एक **serverless compute service** आहे.
➡️ म्हणजे काय?
> *“तुला server manage करायची गरज नाही. फक्त तुझं code लिही, आणि AWS ते automatically चालवेल जेव्हा trigger होईल.”*

## ⚙️ **How Does AWS Lambda Work?**
इथे Step-by-Step बघ:
1. **Code Upload कर (Function):** Tu Python, Node.js, Java, Go etc. मध्ये छोटं function तयार करतोस आणि Lambda वर अपलोड करतोस.

2. **Trigger Define कर:** हे function कधी चालावं हे ठरवायचं
   उदा:
   - API Gateway वरुन call झालं की
   - S3 मधे नवीन फाईल आली की
   - DynamoDB बदलला की
   - Timer/cron job सारखं

4. **AWS Automatically Handle करते:**
   - Code चालवायला लागणारा server create करते (background मध्ये)
   - Scale करते (जेवढं load, तेवढे instances)
   - आणि use झालं नाही तर बंद करते (no idle cost)

5. **You Only Pay for Usage:** किती वेळ function चाललं – त्यासाठीच पैसे. (Milliseconds पर्यंत billing!)

## 📦 **Use Cases of AWS Lambda**

### 🧾 1. **File Processing (S3)**  
S3 मध्ये file upload झाली की Lambda function चालवून:
- image resize कर
- video convert कर
- data extract कर

### 🌐 2. **Backend for Web/Mobile Apps**  
API Gateway + Lambda वापरून आपण backend तयार करू शकतो – *without EC2/servers*.

### ⏰ 3. **Scheduled Tasks (Cron Jobs)**  
जसं की रोज रात्री 12 ला DB clean करायचा task — Lambda + CloudWatch Event वापरून.

### 💬 4. **Real-time Notifications**  
कधी queue मधून message आला (SNS/SQS), तेव्हा Lambda चालवून notification, email, webhook send करू शकतो.

### 🔄 5. **Data Transformation / ETL**  
Lambda वापरून data clean, filter, transform करतो – आणि नंतर दुसऱ्या service मध्ये save करतो (like RDS, S3, etc.).

### 🔐 6. **Security Automation**  
उदा. जर IAM policy बदली गेली, तर Lambda चालवून alert द्या किंवा auto rollback करा.

### 1. What is AWS Lambda?
AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. It automatically scales and manages the infrastructure required to run your code in response to events.

### 2. How does AWS Lambda work?
You can upload your code to Lambda and define event sources that trigger the execution of your code. Lambda automatically manages the execution environment, scales it as needed, and provides monitoring and logging.

### 3. What are the key benefits of using AWS Lambda?
The benefits of AWS Lambda include automatic scaling, reduced operational overhead, cost efficiency (as you pay only for the compute time used), and the ability to build event-driven architectures.

### 4. What types of events can trigger AWS Lambda functions?
AWS Lambda functions can be triggered by various event sources, such as changes in Amazon S3 objects, updates to Amazon DynamoDB tables, HTTP requests through Amazon API Gateway, and more.

### 5. How is concurrency managed in AWS Lambda?
Lambda automatically handles concurrency by scaling out instances of your function in response to incoming requests. You can set a concurrency limit to control how many concurrent executions are allowed.

### 6. What is the maximum execution duration for a single AWS Lambda invocation?
The maximum execution duration for a single Lambda invocation is 15 minutes.

### 7. How do you pass data to and from AWS Lambda functions?
You can pass data to Lambda functions through event objects, which contain information about the triggering event. You can also return data by using the return statement or creating a response object.

### 8. Can AWS Lambda functions communicate with external resources?
Yes, Lambda functions can communicate with external resources such as databases, APIs, and other AWS services by using appropriate SDKs and APIs provided by AWS.

### 9. What are AWS Lambda layers?
AWS Lambda layers are a way to manage and share code that is common across multiple functions. Layers can include libraries, custom runtimes, and other function dependencies.

### 10. How can you handle errors in AWS Lambda functions?
You can handle errors by using try-catch blocks in your code. Lambda also provides CloudWatch Logs for monitoring, and you can set up error handling and retries for asynchronous invocations.

### 11. Can AWS Lambda functions access the internet?
Yes, Lambda functions can access the internet through the Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) or through public endpoints if your function is not configured within a VPC.

### 12. What are the execution environments available for AWS Lambda functions?
Lambda supports several runtimes, including Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Ruby, .NET Core, and custom runtimes using the Runtime API.

### 13. How can you configure environment variables for AWS Lambda functions?
You can set environment variables for Lambda functions when creating or updating the function. These variables can be accessed within your code.

### 14. What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous invocation of Lambda functions?
Synchronous invocations wait for the function to complete and return a response, while asynchronous invocations return immediately, and the response is sent to a specified destination.

### 15. What is the AWS Lambda Event Source Mapping?
Event Source Mapping allows you to connect event sources like Amazon DynamoDB streams or Amazon Kinesis streams to Lambda functions. This enables the function to process events as they occur.

### 16. How can you manage the permissions and execution roles for AWS Lambda functions?
You can use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles to grant permissions to your Lambda functions. Execution roles define what AWS resources the function can access.

### 17. What is AWS Step Functions?
AWS Step Functions is a serverless orchestration service that lets you coordinate multiple AWS services into serverless workflows using visual workflows called state machines.

### 18. How can you automate the deployment of AWS Lambda functions?
You can use AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM) templates, AWS CloudFormation, or CI/CD tools like AWS CodePipeline to automate the deployment of Lambda functions.

### 19. Can AWS Lambda functions connect to on-premises resources?
Yes, Lambda functions can connect to on-premises resources by placing the function inside a VPC and using a VPN or Direct Connect connection to establish connectivity.

### 20. What is the Cold Start issue in AWS Lambda?
The Cold Start issue occurs when a Lambda function is invoked for the first time or after it has been idle for a while. The function needs to be initialized, causing a slight delay in response time.
